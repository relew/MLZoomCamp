Good day Sir/Madam,

Project context:

Every year, more than 8 million companion animals end up in US shelters. Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. About 3 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.

Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center, I will try to predict the outcome for each animal.

The dataset provided by Austin Animal Center. Shelter animal statistics were taken from the ASPCA.

Project target:

Create the most accurate model possible to predict which animals are more likely to get rehomed and understand trends in animal outcomes. These insights could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need a little extra help finding a new home.
